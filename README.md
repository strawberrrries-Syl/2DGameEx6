# Instructions
## Aim
This is a shooting game. But don’t worry, not including death or blood. Your aim is to feed all
cute pets and get the highest score you can! If you missed too many little guys, they will feel
sad and make you restart feeding (restart the game).
## Objects
### Kitties and puppies

They are cats and dogs you will meet. Feed them with the correct kinds of food!
### Foods

Foods for them. You might get meat or fish as your “bullet” and “shoot” at them. Shoot
by pressing the button “ctrl” or the mouse left key.
*  If cats get fish or dogs get meat, they will eat the food. You will get 5 points each
time feed them correctly.
* If reverse, they will complain by meowing or barking. You will lose 2 points each
time feed them incorrectly.
* If you missed some guys, you will also lose 2 points each time. And your missed
tracker will track it. When it comes to 5, the game will be restarted (You lose).

### Player

Your hand! (Basically, your avatar). You can control this with the AD or direction keys (←, →). You can only move horizontally

### Scores and Process
* Three trackers.
* “Process here” will tell you how far from the end of feeding you are now. This means that the percentage you finished feeding.
* “Score here” means the score you got now. (Feed correctly, +5; Feed incorrectly or missed, -2).
* “Missed here” shows how many pets you missed, if greater than 5, game over.
## Controls:
### Players can control the hand by direction keys (←,→) or AD. You can not move up or down.
### Press ‘ctrl’ or the left mouse key to “shoot” foods to pets.
## Ends:
### Lose:
* You missed more than 5 pets
* Your hands are out of the screen
### Win:
* You finished the process and get score.
